# Features
This module is used to make quest items drop for all members of a group. In some cases it also help other objectives count for all members of a group. It adds items that you normally loot from the ground to the loot tables of nearby creatures to make it easier for groups to complete those quests.

# Extra information
I have been asked several times why I made this module if all it takes is a couple of queries to update all quest items. I figured I'd make it clear.

I play with blizzlike rates and want to be able to complete as many quests as possible, not only for the rates of course.

Quest objectives like escorting someone, destroying something or rescuing creatures by destroying a cocoon until they appear etc don't always give +1 to every member of the group and I really wanted to fix that.

The same goes for looting items from objects on the ground. Skipping those really cripple you as a multiboxer if the rates are blizzlike. That's why I'm adding those items to nearby creatures with a reasonably low drop chance as they're only there as an alternative, not replacement.
